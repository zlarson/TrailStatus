# FORC Trail Status Notifier
This was a fun little project that I worked on after getting tired of wondering if the mountain bike trails were open.  Our local bike club maintains the master list of trails statuses so I wrote this small application to scrape their status page and post it to a facebook page.

The use of facebook was kind of a last resort.  I'd prefer to use some sort of registration system where users can sign up to receive my alerts.
